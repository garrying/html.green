			<p class="greentext"> Hello, I'm green! Here are some photographs of previous expeditions into this planet Earth which I am told is the host planet of God.</p>

			<p class="cyantext"> I have been in this QUIET PLACE for a long time. At unexpected<br>
			times something appears; sometimes it is moving<br>
			but most of the time it is still.</p>

			<img src='pool.jpg' style="width:800px;height:400px;"/>

			<p class="magentatext"> It is my favourite hobby, to observe things.<br>
			I feel I am lucky that this is the case, as <br>
			there is very little else to do here. When a new image comes <br>
			I ready myself to look at it, truly look at it.<br><br> </p>

			<img src='darkzen.jpg' style="width:1000px;height:500px;"/>

			Some images take just a few years to look at, and then they are finished -- kaputt. <br>
			Other images are tricky - they give you the feeling of having been looked at, but in reality<br>
			they are inexhaustible, like a store that changes its merchandise daily<br>
			while the fa√ßade remains the same. <br><br>

			I like very much those images. <br>
			They give me a sense not of peace, but of something <i>like</i> peace: each impression replacing the last <br>
			until I am forced to admit there might be something beyond all this, beyond this box in which I live, which I am synonymous with,<br>
			which is all I have ever known.
