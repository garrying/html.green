<h2>Lindsey - Dewson</h2>

<p>I don't know much about this route. It is an east-west route a little north of College. In west end it ends at Brock and there's no safe way to continue. At its east end it ends at Shaw and can kind of connect to Harbord.

<p>It has signalized crossings of Dufferin and Ossington car sewers which are okay and better than any alternative.
