<h1><a href="index.html">West-Central Toronto Bike Routes</a></h1>

<h2>Shaw</h2>

<p>North-south route. North end at Davenport, south end theoretically at Douro (connecting to Wellington), but it's not great past Dundas. Most times I ride between Argyle and Dundas I feel bullied by cars behind me.

<p>Shaw Street continues to King and theoretically connects to <a href="adelaide-richmond.html">Adelaide</a>, but you'd have to be making a left turn across streetcar tracks, nothing here says cyclists are welcome.

<p>Allows through southbound traffic between Harbord and Queen, so it picks up a fair amount of rat runs. Theoretically there is a prohibition on southbound travel across Dundas during rush hours but this is not observed. At least they reversed the stretch between Bloor and Harbord so it doesn't pick up rat runs off Bloor too.
