            <p>
                A cat comes into a bar. The FBI is listening in.

            You may never know if any of these little fellas will ever be found. We just continue on and let these posters age and fade. Maybe happy endings exist for some of them, maybe not. Someone is or was out there looking for them, asking us all to do the same if we can. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have not ever seen any of these pets. I don't know anything about their owners. But their posters intrigued me enough. I took their photos, wanting to keep their memory alive in some way. I hope they all found their peace.
